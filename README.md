# Statistical-Functions-Using-Python
This project include a packet of python codes that can be used to find all basic statistical parameters and conducted advanced statistical tests like T-test, Chi2 test, F test and hypothesis testing 
Python packages being applied in this project include Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Ipython/Jupiter Notebook

###Basic Parameters:

Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Variance, Quartile, IQR, Percentile, Skewness, CoVariance, Z-Score, Outlier, Co-relation coefficient, Permutation, combination, factorial.

###Distributions:

Binomial

Poisson 

Hypergeometric

Uniform

Exponential

To test Central Limit theorm with Uniform Distribution.


###Confidence Interval estimation:

With mean & proportion

Mean difference

Proportion difference

Population variance



###Hypothesis Test:

For mean: 
Upper tailed,lower tailed, two tailed test for both sample and population.
Power in Hypothesis test for mean.

For proportion: 
Upper tailed,lower tailed, two tailed test for both sample and population.

For mean Difference:(Z test & T-test)
Upper tailed,lower tailed, two tailed test for both sample and population.

For proportion difference:(Z test)
Upper tailed,lower tailed, two tailed test.

For Population variance:(Chi2-test)
Upper tailed,lower tailed, two tailed test.

For two Population variance:(F-test)
Upper tailed,lower tailed, two tailed test.
